      <h2>Early Life and Marriage</h2>
      <p>
        Elisabeth was born into the Hungarian royal family and was betrothed at
        a young age to Ludwig IV of Thuringia. She moved to Thuringia, where she
        became known for her piety and charitable works.
        According to a different tradition she was born in Pozsony, Hungary (present-day Bratislava, Slovakia), 
        where she lived in the Castle of Posonium until the age of four. 
        Elizabeth was brought to the court of the rulers of Thuringia in central Germany, to be betrothed to Louis IV, 
        Landgrave of Thuringia (also known as Ludwig IV), a future union which would reinforce political alliances between the two families.
         She was raised by the Thuringian court and would have been familiar with the local language and culture.

      <h3>Elisabeth Church</h3>
      <p>
        Elisabeth Church in Marburg is a significant Gothic church located in Marburg, Germany. 
        It was built between 1235 and 1283 and is one of the earliest purely Gothic structures in Germany. The church was constructed in honor of St. Elisabeth of Hungary, who was canonized in 1235, and whose relics were once housed there, making it an important pilgrimage site. The church's design includes notable features such as its twin towers, large stained glass windows, and intricate stone carvings. It also has a rich history tied to the Teutonic Order, which managed the church for many years. Today, the Elisabeth Church is not only a place of worship but also a historical landmark,
