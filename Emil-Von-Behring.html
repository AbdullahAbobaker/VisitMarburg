      <p class="lead">
        Emil von Behring (1854–1917) was a German physiologist who received the
        first Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1901 for his discovery of
        a diphtheria antitoxin.

      <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
      <p>
        Emil von Behring was born in Hansdorf, West Prussia (now Poland). He
        studied medicine at the Kaiser Wilhelm Academy for Military Physicians
        in Berlin. His early research focused on bacteriology and immunology.
      </p>
      <h2>Scientific Contributions</h2>
      <p>
        Behring's work on serum therapy for diphtheria and tetanus was
        groundbreaking. He discovered that injecting serum from an immunized
        animal could protect and cure humans from these diseases.

              <p>
                Behring's discovery of the diphtheria antitoxin in 1890 was a
                major breakthrough in medicine, saving countless lives.

              <h3>Tetanus Antitoxin</h3>
              <p>
                In 1891, Behring, along with Kitasato Shibasaburō, developed an
                antitoxin for tetanus, significantly reducing mortality rates.

      <h2>Legacy</h2>
      <p>
        Emil von Behring's contributions to immunology and infectious disease
        treatment have had a lasting impact on medicine. His pioneering work
        laid the foundation for modern therapies and vaccines.
      </p>
      <p>
        He is remembered not only for his scientific achievements but also for
        his dedication to improving public health. Marburg, where he spent much
        of his career, honors his legacy with numerous memorials and a dedicated
        research institute.
