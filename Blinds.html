      <h1 id="title">The City of The Blinds</h1>
      <p class="lead">
        Marburg in Germany is renowned as a Blindenstadt, a city designed to facilitate the lives of the blind and partially sighted. This distinction and its inclusive community are largely credited to the pioneering efforts of a particular school.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>In Marburg, there are aids available for people with disabilities 
        to navigate independently in public spaces. Here we present these aids, which are extensively available in the city center and at some locations in the outskirts:</p>
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>
        Tactile paving at traffic lights
      </h2>
      <p>To locate traffic lights, tactile paving is laid across the sidewalk perpendicular to the walking direction, leading to the traffic light pole.</p>

      </div>
      <h2>Audible beacon</h2>
      <p>At certain intersections in pedestrian areas where natural stone is laid, making tactile paving less noticeable, audible beacons (clicking sound) are installed to locate the traffic light pole, which becomes louder with increasing traffic noise.</p>
     <h2>Acoustic signals</h2>
     <p>Different signal tones are audible during the pedestrian green phase.</p>

     </div>
     <h2>Vibration button with tactile arrow</h2>
     <p> During the pedestrian green phase, the upper part of the button vibrates. The tactile arrow helps orient pedestrians in the direction to cross the street.</p>
     <h2>Attention fields at bus stops</h2>
     <p>Attention strips are gradually being set up at bus stops across the city, perpendicular to the walking direction, leading to the front door of the bus when it stops.</p>
     <div class="image-divs">

     </div>
     <p>These aids contribute to making Marburg more accessible and supportive for the blind and visually impaired in their daily lives.
        Marburg's commitment to accessibility and its status as a Blindenstadt reflect a comprehensive approach to enhancing the quality of life for individuals with visual impairments, ensuring they can navigate and participate fully in the city's social, educational, and economic life.
