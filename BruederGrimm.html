      <p class="lead">
        The Brothers Grimm, Jacob (1785–1863) and Wilhelm (1786–1859), were
        German scholars, philologists, cultural researchers, and authors who
        together collected and published folklore during the 19th century.

      <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
      <p>
        The brothers were born in the town of Hanau in Hesse-Cassel, and spent
        most of their childhood in the nearby town of Steinau. They were the
        eldest surviving sons of Philipp Wilhelm Grimm, a lawyer, and his wife
        Dorothea Grimm née Zimmer. Their early academic work included the study
        of law at the University of Marburg, where they were influenced by their
        professor Friedrich Karl von Savigny.
      </p>
      <h2>Folklore Collection and Publication</h2>
      <p>
        Inspired by their interest in German folklore and their academic work,
        the Brothers Grimm started to collect oral folk tales and traditions.
        They published the first volume of "Children's and Household Tales"
        (Kinder- und Hausmärchen) in 1812, with a second volume following in
        1815. The collection was expanded in subsequent editions and became a
        seminal work in the field of folklore and fairy tales.
      </p>

      <h2>Legacy</h2>
      <p>
        The Brothers Grimm are regarded as pioneers in the field of folklore
        studies and their work has had a lasting impact on the preservation and
        appreciation of traditional stories. Their tales have been translated
        into numerous languages and adapted into countless films, books, and
        other media, making them an integral part of world literature and
        culture.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their work also contributed to the study of linguistics and philology,
        and their extensive research on German language and grammar laid the
        groundwork for future studies in these fields. The Brothers Grimm are
        celebrated not only for their fairy tales but also for their
        contributions to German culture and scholarship.
